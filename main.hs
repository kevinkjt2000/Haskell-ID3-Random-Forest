{-  Program Assignment 1 Description from iLearn
Write a program that implements a Random Forest of unpruned ID3 trees. You can assume categorical data and no missing values. You do not need to know attribute names; you can call them att_1 â€¦ att_n or have an array of attributes. You can assume that the class is the first column of a comma-separated file. Start with the soybean-small.dat file attached to this assignment.

The program will take the number of trees and the data file name as an argument (runtime options) and output a confusion matrix produced using 10-fold crossvalidation. The Random Forest will use bootstrapping to select the training data for the tree and will random select an attribute subset of size N, where N is the first integer less than log2(M+1) and M is the number of available attributes. The out-of-bag accuracy estimate will be computed and output after the addition of each tree. The out-of-bag estimate will only include instances that do not appear in the training set for at least one of the trees. Thus, there will be some instances excluded from the out-of-bag estimate until there is a sufficient number of trees in your forest.
