This project relies on Haskell. The simplest way of installing Haskell,
is downloading the Haskell Platform from https://www.haskell.org/platform/

Once Haskell is installed, there are some extra libraries that must be installed.
The following command should download and install the necessary extra libraries:
    cabal update && cabal install HTF pretty-tree random-shuffle

The Haskell compiler might say that htfpp could not be located.
This is because cabal does not add its bin directory to PATH by default.
Simply add the correct folder to your system's PATH.
    Linux:   ~/.cabal/bin
    Mac OSX: ~/Library/Haskell/bin
    Windows: %APPDATA%\cabal\bin

To compile and run a normal build on Linux and Mac OSX:
    cabal configure && cabal build
    dist/build/random_forest/random_forest <number of trees> <data filename>

To compile and run a normal build on Windows:
    cabal configure && cabal build
    dist\build\random_forest\random_forest.exe <number of trees> <data filename>

To compile and run a test build:
    cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build && cabal test
